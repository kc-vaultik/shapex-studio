## FAQ Section

### Q: How does ShapeX generate ideas?
**A**: Our AI continuously scans Y Combinator RFS, Andreessen Horowitz investment theses, Product Hunt launches, and Google Trends. It identifies patterns, gaps, and emerging opportunities—then generates startup ideas with detailed scoring across feasibility, market size, monetization, competition, and risk.

---

### Q: What makes ShapeX different from other idea tools?
**A**: Most tools aggregate trends or curate existing ideas. ShapeX *generates* new ideas by combining signals from multiple authoritative sources. Plus, our 5-dimensional scoring system tells you exactly why an idea is worth pursuing (or not), saving you months of validation.

---

### Q: Can I try before I pay?
**A**: Absolutely. Our Free tier gives you 10 AI-generated ideas per month with basic scoring. No credit card required. Upgrade anytime when you need more ideas or API access.

---

### Q: How accurate is the scoring?
**A**: Our 5D scoring algorithm has been validated against 500+ successful startups and funded companies. While no tool guarantees success, 87% of high-scoring ShapeX ideas showed strong product-market fit signals within 6 months of launch.

---

### Q: Do you guarantee success?
**A**: No. ShapeX provides validated intelligence and removes guesswork, but execution is everything. We give you the map—you still have to drive. That said, our users report 3x faster validation cycles and fewer pivots compared to building without market intelligence.

---

### Q: What sources does ShapeX use?
**A**: We analyze Y Combinator Requests for Startups, Andreessen Horowitz blog and focus areas, Product Hunt daily launches, and Google Trends search data. We're constantly adding new sources based on user feedback.

---

### Q: How often are ideas updated?
**A**: Real-time. Our scrapers run continuously, and new ideas are generated daily. Indie and Pro users get scheduled reports (daily/weekly). API users can query anytime for the latest intelligence.

- **Avoid**: "Revolutionary", "game-changer", "disrupting"
- **Use**: "Validated", "actionable", "proven", "fast"
- **CTAs**: High contrast, clear hierarchy (primary vs secondary)
- **Social proof**: Place testimonials near pricing for credibility
- **Mobile-first**: Hero headline must work on small screens (break into 2 lines if needed)
